# What to Expect from the Course:
This course takes a hands-on and a practical approach. We aim to help you understand why design patterns are essential and what drives their creation in a compendious manner. The patterns weâ€™ll be diving into include:

Behavioral Patterns:
* Strategy
* Observer

Creational Patterns:
* Factory
* Builder
* Singleton
* 
Structural Patterns:
* Facade
* Adapter
* Decorator

Each article will follow this structure:
1. Motivation - Introducing a specific problem and looking at potential solutions, leading us to the need for a refined design pattern.
2. The Solution - Showcasing the design pattern and emphasizing its strengths over traditional solutions.
3. Design and Implementation - Detailed UML diagrams will be provided, accompanied by code snippets in multiple languages (JavaScript, Java, C++, and Python) with annotations to guide you. Not only this, but language-specific notes are included to help understand implementation differences among these four languages.
4. Limitations and Pitfalls - Addressing scenarios where a pattern might not be the best fit.
5. Use Cases - Examples of real-world applications for each pattern.
6. Closing Notes - Summing up the design principles each pattern embodies and reflecting on their importance.
