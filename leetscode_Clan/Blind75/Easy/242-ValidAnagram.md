# 242. Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

## Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

## Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

## Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
* s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
 
Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

## Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution with O(n + m) time and O(1) space, where n is the length of the string s and m is the length of the string t.
